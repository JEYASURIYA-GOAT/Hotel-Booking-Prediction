# Hotel-Booking-Prediction
Predicting hotel bookings is a classic problem in data science, often tackled using machine learning techniques. To build a predictive model for hotel bookings, you would typically gather historical data about bookings, including various features that might influence bookings. Here's a general overview of steps you might take:

Data Collection: Gather historical data on hotel bookings. This data should include information about bookings such as dates, location, type of room booked, duration of stay, number of guests, booking channel, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones that might be useful for predicting hotel bookings. For example, you might create features such as:

Day of the week
Month
Season
Length of stay
Lead time (time between booking and check-in)
Historical booking trends
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data to gain insights into patterns, correlations, and trends. Visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots can be useful for this purpose.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for prediction. Common models for this task include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Neural Networks
Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search can be used for this purpose.

Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is trained, deploy it into production for making predictions on new data.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model and update it as needed to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.
